# AGE-GENDER-PREDICTOR

A web-based application that predicts a person's age and gender from a facial image using a TensorFlow.js model. The application is hosted on Firebase, enabling real-time inference directly in the browser without the need for server-side computation.

**MODEL**: ResNet34<br>
**WEBSITE LINK**: https://age-gender-predicter.web.app



## Features

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet model converted to TensorFlow.js for instant age and gender predictions in the browser.
- **Edge Deployment**: Runs entirely on the client-side, ensuring user privacy and eliminating server dependencies.
- **Firebase Hosting**: Seamless deployment and hosting using Firebase, providing a scalable and reliable platform for the application.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
